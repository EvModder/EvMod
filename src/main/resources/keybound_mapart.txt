#========== Enable Commands ==========#
# /setmapartgroup <name> - Create a file in ./mods/config/keybound/mapart_group_<name>, which is a binary list of all MapStates loaded for you client's current session.
# This can be manually compared against other files to find overlap, set compliments, etc.
# I've also made it so any MapState the game encounters which are NOT in the currently set group will have a colored name ingame (which is useful to quickly identify maps you haven't yet collected)
